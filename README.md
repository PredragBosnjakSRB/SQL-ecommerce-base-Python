# E-commerce Platform for Local Agricultural Products

This project simulates a complete e-commerce system with a relational SQL database and Python-based data analytics. It focuses on the sale of fresh local agricultural products — including fruits, vegetables, meat, honey, and homemade goods — offered by small rural producers.

It also introduces the concept of a weekly curated “Farm Box” with seasonal items, recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, and basic analytics for tracking performance.
